My #NA
15 #NA
year #NA
old #NA
Daughter #NA
has #NA
sores #SB
in #NA
her #NA
mouth. #NA
She #NA
also #NA
has #NA
flu-like #SB
symptoms. #SC
Is #NA
this #NA
possible? #NA
Thank #NA
You. #NA
I #NA
am #NA
a #NA
20 #NA
year #NA
old #NA
girl #NA
from #NA
Austria, #NA
have #NA
been #NA
to #NA
many #NA
doctors #NA
but #NA
no #NA
one #NA
listens. #NA
I #NA
got #NA
two #NA
huge #NA
problems #NA
which #NA
prevent #NA
me #NA
from #NA
doing #NA
my #NA
beloved #NA
sport! #NA
I #NA
run #NA
since #NA
age #NA
16 #NA
and #NA
never #NA
had #NA
problems, #NA
I #NA
always #NA
wore #NA
proper #NA
shoes. #NA
Last #NA
year #NA
I #NA
joined #NA
gymnastics #NA
too #NA
and #NA
I #NA
got #NA
very #SB
bad #SC
posterior #SC
shin #SC
splints #SC
on #SC
the #SC
right #SC
leg. #SC
After #NA
a #NA
few #NA
weeks #NA
I #NA
stopped #NA
training #NA
and #NA
iced #NA
it #NA
to #NA
get #NA
rid #NA
of #NA
inflammation. #SB
I #NA
am #NA
not #NA
in #NA
training #NA
since #NA
3 #NA
months #NA
now, #NA
all #NA
I #NA
did #NA
was #NA
walking #NA
the #NA
dog #NA
a #NA
lot. #NA
I #NA
went #NA
to #NA
several #NA
doctor, #NA
and #NA
one #NA
told #NA
me #NA
I #NA
have #NA
a #NA
huge #SB
over-pro-nation #SC
and #NA
I #NA
got #NA
insoles. #SB
Now #NA
the #NA
pain #NA
is #NA
all #NA
gone, #NA
but #NA
I #NA
still #NA
got #NA
kind #NA
of #NA
a #NA
"pressure" #SB
on #SC
the #SC
shin #SC
bone #SC
when #NA
I #NA
jump. #NA
I #NA
want #NA
to #NA
become #NA
a #NA
sports #NA
teacher #NA
since #NA
ever #NA
and #NA
training #NA
starts #NA
next #NA
week. #NA
I #NA
got #NA
1 #NA
time #NA
track #NA
and #NA
field #NA
and #NA
4 #NA
times #NA
gymnastics #NA
training #NA
each #NA
week. #NA
What #NA
can #NA
I #NA
do #NA
to #NA
prevent #NA
getting #NA
shin #SB
splints #SC
again? #NA
I #NA
won't #NA
go #NA
running #NA
and #NA
in #NA
track #NA
and #NA
field #NA
training #NA
I #NA
will #NA
wear #NA
good #NA
shoes #NA
with #NA
insoles. #NA
In #NA
free #NA
time #NA
I #NA
will #NA
try #NA
to #NA
walk #NA
on #NA
the #NA
"outer #NA
part" #NA
of #NA
the #NA
foot. #NA
But #NA
in #NA
gymnastics #NA
I #NA
cannot #NA
wear #NA
any #NA
shoes! #NA
What #NA
can #NA
I #NA
do #NA
and #NA
what #NA
is #NA
my #NA
prognosis #NA
of #NA
getting #NA
it #NA
back? #NA
Second #NA
problem #NA
are #NA
my #NA
arms. #NA
I #NA
got #NA
a #NA
pulling #SB
pain #SC
in #SC
the #SC
whole #SC
arm #SC
especially #NA
in #NA
the #NA
upper #NA
arm. #NA
It #NA
gets #NA
worse #NA
with #NA
weight #NA
training #NA
(biceps #NA
curls) #NA
but #NA
also #NA
from #NA
stretching #NA
and #NA
supporting #NA
myself #NA
while #NA
tumbling. #NA
When #NA
its #NA
worst #NA
my #NA
inner #SB
part #SC
of #SC
the #SC
elbow #SC
hurts #SC
like #NA
hell #NA
and #NA
its #NA
a #NA
pulling #NA
pain #NA
in #NA
the #NA
whole #NA
arm. #NA
There #NA
is #NA
no #SB
redness, #SC
swelling #SC
or #SC
bruising #SC
and #NA
it #NA
doesn't #NA
get #NA
worse #NA
when #NA
I #NA
touch #NA
it. #NA
Nerves #NA
have #NA
been #NA
checked #NA
but #NA
everything #NA
ok. #NA
I #NA
guess #NA
its #NA
due #NA
to #NA
stretching #NA
my #NA
shoulders #NA
a #NA
lot #NA
so #NA
I #NA
got #NA
elbow #SB
strains! #SC
I #NA
switched #NA
to #NA
rhythmic #NA
gymnastics #NA
so #NA
I #NA
won't #NA
have #NA
to #NA
work #NA
on #NA
my #NA
arm #NA
strength #NA
as #NA
much #NA
as #NA
in #NA
artistic #NA
gymnastics, #NA
I #NA
won't #NA
do #NA
pull-ups #NA
or #NA
bars, #NA
just #NA
walkovers, #NA
handsprings #NA
and #NA
stuff #NA
like #NA
that, #NA
but #NA
they #NA
all #NA
require #NA
a #NA
big #NA
flexibility #NA
in #NA
the #NA
shoulders. #NA
Now #NA
it #NA
is #NA
better #NA
because #NA
I #NA
didn't #NA
train #NA
for #NA
weeks #NA
but #NA
as #NA
soon #NA
as #NA
I #NA
stretch #NA
or #NA
do #NA
walkovers #NA
I #NA
can #NA
feel #NA
the #NA
light #NA
pulling #NA
in #NA
my #NA
arm #NA
connecting #NA
to #NA
the #NA
elbow #NA
and #NA
a #NA
light #NA
"pressure" #NA
an #NA
the #NA
inner #NA
elbow. #NA
What #NA
can #NA
I #NA
do #NA
prevent #NA
it #NA
and #NA
how #NA
is #NA
the #NA
diagnosis #NA
of #NA
never #NA
getting #NA
this #NA
again #NA
with #NA
proper #NA
measures? #NA
Does #NA
one #NA
of #NA
these #NA
problems #NA
mean #NA
I #NA
won't #NA
be #NA
able #NA
to #NA
continue #NA
training #NA
to #NA
reach #NA
my #NA
dream-job #NA
as #NA
a #NA
sports #NA
teacher? #NA
I #NA
would #NA
really #NA
appreciate #NA
any #NA
kind #NA
of #NA
help! #NA
Thanks, #NA
Kate #NA
My #NA
wife #NA
had #NA
a #NA
headache #SB
for #NA
3 #NA
days. #NA
Today #NA
she #NA
became #NA
nauseous #SB
on #NA
the #NA
way #NA
home #NA
after #NA
lunch. #NA
She #NA
has #NA
now #NA
vomited #SB
six #NA
times. #NA
She #NA
has #NA
ache #SB
in #SC
joints. #SC
She #NA
has #NA
no #SB
strength. #SC
Continues #NA
to #NA
feel #NA
as #NA
if #NA
hit #SB
by #SC
bowling #SC
ball #SC
just #SC
below #SC
the #SC
chest. #SC
What #NA
can #NA
I #NA
do #NA
to #NA
help #NA
her. #NA
Hello, #NA
I #NA
practice #NA
ashtanga #NA
yoga #NA
once #NA
or #NA
twice #NA
a #NA
week #NA
and #NA
ride #NA
my #NA
bicycle #NA
around #NA
town. #NA
Yesterday #NA
evening #NA
I #NA
went #NA
to #NA
a #NA
yoga #NA
session #NA
and #NA
was #NA
taught #NA
a #NA
new #NA
posture #NA
that #NA
required #NA
a #NA
high #NA
level #NA
of #NA
flexibility #NA
in #NA
my #NA
knees, #NA
in #NA
addition #NA
to #NA
performing #NA
several #NA
others #NA
in #NA
the #NA
same #NA
session #NA
that #NA
are #NA
normally #NA
demanding #NA
on #NA
knees, #NA
and #NA
then #NA
I #NA
rode #NA
home #NA
on #NA
my #NA
bike. #NA
I've #NA
never #NA
had #NA
a #NA
problem #NA
before #NA
with #NA
my #NA
knees #NA
(I'm #NA
hyper-flexible #NA
so #NA
I've #NA
always #NA
taken #NA
care #NA
to #NA
try #NA
and #NA
not #NA
overextend #NA
my #NA
joints), #NA
but #NA
after #NA
my #NA
session #NA
I #NA
noticed #NA
a #NA
bulbous #SB
lump #SC
behind #SC
my #SC
knee. #SC
It #NA
doesn't #NA
hurt, #NA
really, #NA
but #NA
I #NA
feel #NA
stiffness, #SB
weakness #SB
and #NA
a #NA
general #NA
feeling #NA
of #NA
"I #NA
should #NA
not #NA
be #NA
doing #NA
this" #NA
pressure #NA
in #NA
the #NA
area #NA
when #NA
I #NA
walk #NA
or #NA
move #NA
my #NA
knee. #NA
I #NA
did #NA
my #NA
research, #NA
of #NA
course. #NA
I'm #NA
keeping #NA
off #NA
my #NA
feet #NA
and #NA
taking #NA
ibuprofen. #NA
I #NA
only #NA
recently #NA
signed #NA
up #NA
for #NA
health #NA
insurance #NA
a #NA
week #NA
ago #NA
and #NA
haven't #NA
received #NA
my #NA
policy #NA
papers #NA
yet #NA
in #NA
the #NA
mail. #NA
I'm #NA
not #NA
sure #NA
if #NA
I #NA
should #NA
wait #NA
to #NA
receive #NA
them #NA
and #NA
meanwhile #NA
see #NA
if #NA
it #NA
gets #NA
better, #NA
or #NA
if #NA
I #NA
should #NA
go #NA
to #NA
a #NA
doctor #NA
tomorrow. #NA
I #NA
should #NA
also #NA
note #NA
that #NA
I #NA
have #NA
no #NA
idea #NA
how #NA
much #NA
it #NA
would #NA
cost #NA
if #NA
my #NA
insurance #NA
is #NA
not #NA
in #NA
effect #NA
and #NA
I'm #NA
currently #NA
in #NA
between #NA
paychecks. #NA
Lastly, #NA
how #NA
long #NA
must #NA
the #NA
average #NA
person #NA
generally #NA
wait #NA
for #NA
it #NA
to #NA
heal/go #NA
away? #NA
Are #NA
we #NA
talking #NA
a #NA
week #NA
of #NA
no #NA
exercise #NA
and #NA
little #NA
walking, #NA
just #NA
sitting #NA
down, #NA
or #NA
less #NA
time, #NA
or #NA
more? #NA
Thanks #NA
in #NA
advance! #NA

Hello, #NA
I #NA
think #NA
my #NA
wife #NA
ate #NA
some #NA
bad #NA
cantaloupe/ #NA
watermelon #NA
last #NA
night. #NA
She #NA
started #NA
throwing #SB
up #SC
a #NA
couple #NA
hours #NA
later. #NA
She #NA
has #NA
been #NA
throwing #NA
up #NA
(now #NA
dry #NA
heaves) #NA
all #NA
night #NA
- #NA
past #NA
six #NA
hours. #NA
Her #NA
stomach #SB
is #SC
hurting #SC
her #NA
- #NA
should #NA
I #NA
take #NA
her #NA
to #NA
the #NA
emergency #NA
room. #NA
We #NA
are #NA
wondering #NA
if #NA
the #NA
emergency #NA
room #NA
would #NA
be #NA
able #NA
to #NA
do #NA
anything #NA
for #NA
the #NA
pain #NA
in #NA
her #NA
stomach #NA
- #NA
if #NA
there #NA
is #NA
little #NA
they #NA
can #NA
do #NA
but #NA
wait #NA
it #NA
out #NA
- #NA
we #NA
can #NA
do #NA
that #NA
without #NA
wasting #NA
a #NA
trip #NA
in. #NA
There #NA
is #NA
no #SB
blood #SC
in #SC
her #SC
vomit #SC
- #NA
just #NA
cantaloupe #NA
and #NA
now #NA
just #NA
water. #NA
She #NA
is #NA
53 #NA
years #NA
old. #NA
Woke #NA
up #NA
two #NA
days #NA
ago #NA
feeling #NA
like #NA
a #NA
was #NA
walking #NA
on #NA
a #NA
cloud. #NA
All #NA
my #NA
movements #NA
feel #NA
like #NA
they #NA
are #NA
slow #NA
motion #NA
it's #NA
is #NA
like #NA
I #NA
have #NA
to #NA
really #NA
think #NA
about #NA
how #NA
I #NA
need #NA
to #NA
move #NA
my #NA
body. #NA
I #NA
have #NA
felt #NA
this #NA
way #NA
before #NA
but #NA
it #NA
has #NA
always #NA
been #NA
when #NA
I #NA
wake #NA
up #NA
in #NA
the #NA
middle #NA
of #NA
the #NA
night #NA
and #NA
can't #SB
fall #SC
back #SC
asleep. #SC
The #NA
last #NA
time #NA
it #NA
happened #NA
was #NA
over #NA
a #NA
year #NA
ago #NA
and #NA
it #NA
always #NA
cures #NA
it #NA
self #NA
one #NA
I #NA
get #NA
some #NA
sleep #NA
but #NA
this #NA
time #NA
it #NA
doesn't #NA
seem #NA
to #NA
do #NA
the #NA
trick. #NA
My #NA
breathing #NA
and #NA
speech #NA
are #NA
fine #NA
but #NA
it #NA
is #NA
hard #SB
to #SC
think #SC
clearly. #SC
All #NA

the #NA
strange #SB
feeling #SC

in #SC
my #SC

Hi #NA
doc, #NA
I #NA
am #NA
a #NA
skinny #SB
lady #NA
who #NA
is #NA
quite #NA
prone #NA
to #NA
bruising #SB
and #NA
usually #NA
they #NA
are #NA
on #NA
my #NA
legs #NA
and #NA
nowhere #NA
else. #NA
Most #NA
of #NA
the #NA
bruises #NA
i #NA
had #NA
were #NA
due #NA
to #NA
hitting #NA
onto #NA
something #NA
hard #NA

bruise #SC
on #SC
my #SC
left #SC
leg #SC
which #NA
i #NA
couldnt #NA
really #NA
remember #NA
whats #NA
the #NA
cause #NA
of #NA
it #NA
and #NA
I #NA
started #NA
panicking #NA
and #NA
the #NA
first #NA
thought #NA
that #NA
came #NA
across #NA
my #NA
mind #NA
was #NA
cancer #NA
(leukaemia). #NA
This #NA
new #NA
bruise #NA
on #NA
my #NA
leg #NA
isnt #NA
those #NA
reddish #NA
purplish #NA
or #NA
bumpy #NA
kind #NA
of #NA
bruises.. #NA
Its #NA
flat #SB
and #SC
greenish #SC
in #NA
colour #NA
which #NA
is #NA
quite #NA
fade. #NA
I #NA
am #NA
really #NA
worried #NA
its #NA
cancer #NA
related #NA
issues.. #NA
I #NA
dont #NA
have #NA
any #NA
other #NA
symptoms #NA
other #NA
than #NA
this #NA
bruises. #NA

done #NA
X-Ray's #NA

the #NA

the #NA

a #NA

Hi #NA
there, #NA
I #NA
have #NA
a #NA
small #SB
lump #SC
under #SC
the #SC
skin #SC
on #SC
my #SC
scalp #SC
which #NA
you #NA
cannot #NA
see #NA
but #NA
can #NA
feel. #NA
I #NA
have #NA
seen #NA
a #NA
doctor #NA
about #NA
it #NA
and #NA
he #NA
has #NA
told #NA
me #NA
its #NA
a #NA
sebaceous #SB
cyst. #SC
My #NA
main #NA
concern #NA
is #NA
it #NA
has #NA
gotten #NA
bigger #NA
and #NA
a #NA
bit #NA
harder #NA
since #NA
i #NA
went #NA
to #NA
the #NA
doctors #NA
which #NA
was #NA
only #NA
two #NA
months #NA
ago #NA
he #NA
said #NA
it #NA
would #NA
take #NA
years #NA
to #NA
grow. #NA
I #NA
have #NA
been #NA
playing #NA
with #NA
it #NA
a #NA
bit #NA
so #NA
i #NA
am #NA
not #NA
sure #NA
if #NA
maybe #NA
thats #NA
why #NA
its #NA
gotten #NA
bigger #NA
or #NA
not? #NA
Im #NA
a #NA
bit #NA
worried #NA
it #NA
may #NA
be #NA
cancerous #NA
is #NA
this #NA
possible? #NA
Should #NA
i #NA
get #NA
a #NA
second #NA
opinion? #NA
The #NA
doctor #NA
just #NA
felt #NA
it #NA
and #NA
told #NA
me #NA
straight #NA
away #NA
it #NA
was #NA
a #NA
cyst #NA
there #NA
was #NA
no #NA
testing #NA
which #NA
is #NA
was #NA
worries #NA
me. #NA
If #NA
you #NA
could #NA
give #NA
me #NA
some #NA
advice #NA
it #NA
would #NA
be #NA
much #NA
appreciated. #NA

Hi, #NA
One #NA
of #NA
my #NA
friend #NA
is #NA
suffering #NA
from #NA
"Shortness #SB
of #SC
Breath" #SC
and #NA
this #NA
generally #NA
occurs #NA
twice #NA
or #NA
thrice #NA
in #NA
a #NA
fortnight #NA
and #NA
this #NA
sysmptom #NA
is #NA
not #NA
dependent #NA
on #NA
carrying #NA
out #NA
any #NA
heavy #NA
physical #NA
activity. #NA
Although #NA
he #NA
smokes/ #NA
drink #NA
occasionally. #NA
So #NA
was #NA
just #NA
willing #NA
to #NA
know #NA
is #NA
this #NA
"Shortness #NA
of #NA
Breath" #NA
is #NA
being #NA
caused #NA
as #NA
a #NA
part #NA
of #NA
development #NA
of #NA
any #NA
cancer #NA
tissue #NA
or #NA
if #NA
this #NA
is #NA
not #NA
then, #NA
will #NA
this #NA
issue #NA
can #NA
lead #NA
to #NA
developing #NA
cancer? #NA
Although #NA
on #NA
carrying #NA
out #NA
few #NA
medical #NA
tests #NA
it #NA
was #NA
found #NA
that #NA
the #NA
issue #NA
may #NA
had #NA
occured #NA
because #NA
of #NA
anemia #NA
but #NA
if #NA
this #NA
is #NA
just #NA
because #NA
of #NA
anemia #NA
then #NA
I #NA
would #NA
like #NA
to #NA
bring #NA
one #NA
thing #NA
in #NA
one #NA
notice #NA
that #NA
then #NA
the #NA
severity #NA
of #NA
the #NA
"shortness #NA
of #NA
breath" #NA
should #NA
not #NA
have #NA
to #NA
be #NA
very #NA
acute. #NA
And #NA
yes, #NA
he #NA
is #NA
not #SB
having #SC
any #SC
allergic #SC
symptoms. #SC
Please #NA
advice #NA
what #NA
is #NA
the #NA
likelihood #NA
of #NA
cancer #NA
in #NA
this #NA
case. #NA
I #NA
just #NA
recently #NA
got #NA
over #NA
a #NA
diagnosis #SB
of #SC
colitis. #SC
I'm #NA
24 #NA
years #NA
old #NA
6"1 #NA
215lbs. #NA
I #NA
run #NA
5-6 #NA
times #NA
per #NA
week #NA
and #NA
very #NA
healthy. #NA
Last #NA
wednesday #NA
I #NA
went #NA
to #NA
the #NA
doctor #NA
because #NA
i #NA
was #NA
having #NA
bloating, #SB
cramping #SB
and #NA
pain #SB
in #SC
my #SC
lower #SC
left #SC
abdomen. #SC
They #NA
diagnosed #NA
it #NA
with #NA
colitis #SB
and #NA
gave #NA
me #NA
meds #NA
to #NA
take #NA
for #NA
several #NA
days #NA
and #NA
then #NA
to #NA
come #NA
back #NA
for #NA
a #NA
follow #NA
up #NA
a #NA
week #NA
later. #NA
Yesterday #NA
i #NA
went #NA
for #NA
my #NA
follow #NA
up #NA
and #NA
things #NA
have #NA
gotten #NA
99 #NA
percent #NA
better. #NA
The #NA
meds #NA
have #NA
worked #NA
and #NA
most #NA
of #NA
cramping #NA
bloating #NA
is #NA
gone. #NA
The #NA
doctor #NA
believed #NA
it #NA
was #NA
just #NA
an #NA
infection #NA
of #NA
the #NA
colon #NA
etc. #NA
Well #NA
yesterday #NA
after #NA
my #NA
visit #NA
I #NA
started #NA
having #NA
diaherrea. #SB
I #NA
did #NA
have #NA
blood #NA
work, #NA
urine #NA
tests #NA
and #NA
my #NA
stool #NA
all #NA
tested #NA
and #NA
examined #NA
and #NA
everything #NA
was #NA
completely #NA
fine. #NA
The #NA
doctor #NA
did #NA
not #NA
want #NA
to #NA
do #NA
a #NA
CT #NA
scan #NA
because #NA
my #NA
condition #NA
has #NA
improved #NA
almost #NA
completely #NA
and #NA
did #NA
not #NA
want #NA
to #NA
expose #NA
me #NA
to #NA
the #NA
radiation. #NA
The #NA
diaherrea #NA
is #NA
now #NA
gone, #NA
but #NA
there #NA
is #NA
a #NA
full #NA
feeling/ #NA
discomfort #SB
now #SC
under #SC
my #SC
right #SC
rib #SC
cage. #SC
It #NA
does #NA
not #NA
hurt #NA
it #NA
just #NA
feels #NA
weird #NA
like #NA
there #NA
is #NA
extra #NA
air #NA
in #NA
there #NA
and #NA
sometimes #NA
I #NA
feel #NA
it #NA
a #NA
little #NA
bit #NA
in #NA
my #NA
upper #NA
right #NA
side #NA
of #NA
my #NA
back. #NA
Not #NA
painful #NA
just #NA
discomfort. #NA
I'm #NA
starting #NA
to #NA
wonder... #NA
I #NA
talked #NA
to #NA
the #NA
doctor #NA
about #NA
the #NA
poss #NA
of #NA
it #NA
being #NA
cancer #NA
or #NA
a #NA
tumor #NA
or #NA
liver #NA
cancer #NA
and #NA
he #NA
said #NA
highly #NA
unlikely. #NA
Could #NA
this #NA
be #NA
happening #NA
because #NA
the #NA
infection #NA
may #NA
not #NA
totally #NA
be #NA
out #NA
of #NA
my #NA
body #NA
or #NA
do #NA
you #NA
think #NA
this #NA
is #NA
cancer #NA
etc/something #NA
serious? #NA
These #NA
symptoms #NA
just #NA
started #NA
happening #NA
yesterday #NA
after #NA
my #NA
follow #NA
up #NA
and #NA
I #NA
have #NA
felt #NA
99 #NA
percent #NA
better #NA
since #NA
taking #NA
the #NA
medicine #NA
etc. #NA
Is #NA
this #NA
something #NA
I #NA
should #NA
be #NA
worried #NA
about #NA
and #NA
should #NA
I #NA
go #NA
back #NA
to #NA
the #NA
doctor #NA
for #NA
this??? #NA
Please #NA
help... #NA
if #NA
additional #NA
info #NA
is #NA
needed #NA
let #NA
me #NA
know. #NA
I #NA
accidentally #NA
burned #SB
myself #SC
on #SC
the #SC
forearm #SC
about #NA
a #NA
week #NA
ago. #NA
Immediately #NA
the #NA
top #NA
layer #NA
of #NA
skin #NA
was #NA
burned #NA
off #NA
leaving #NA
an #NA
open #NA
wound. #NA
I #NA
don't #NA
believe #NA
it #NA
was #NA
too #NA
deep, #NA
maybe #NA
just #NA
a #NA
few #NA
layers #NA
of #NA
skin #NA
deep. #NA
It #NA
is #NA
almost #NA
a #NA
perfect #NA
circle, #NA
the #NA
size #NA
of #NA
a #NA
pepperoni #NA
(looks #NA
like #NA
one #NA
too #NA
haha). #NA
I #NA
am #NA
a #NA
bit #NA
concerned #NA
that #NA
it #NA
may #NA
be #NA
infected. #NA
When #NA
it #NA
first #NA
happened #NA
I #NA
immediately #NA
put #NA
it #NA
under #NA
cold #NA
water #NA
for #NA
about #NA
10-15 #NA
minutes #NA
and #NA
applied #NA
silver #NA
sulfadizine #NA
on #NA
it #NA
that #NA
i #NA
had #NA
left #NA
over #NA
at #NA
home #NA
from #NA
a #NA
previous #NA
incident. #NA
No #NA
blister #NA
was #NA
formed #NA
but #NA
the #NA
skin #NA
keeps #NA
scabbing #NA
up. #NA
I #NA
had #NA
it #NA
covered #NA
with #NA
a #NA
bandage #NA
but #NA
whenever #NA
I #NA
took #NA
the #NA
bandage #NA
off, #NA
the #NA
newly #NA
formed #NA
tissue/scab #NA
would #NA
come #NA
right #NA
off #NA
with #NA
the #NA
bandage. #NA
I #NA
am #NA
not #NA
too #NA
sure #NA
if #NA
that #NA
is #NA
what #NA
I #NA
want #NA
to #NA
happen #NA
or #NA
not #NA
to #NA
happen. #NA
The #NA
past #NA
two #NA
days #NA
i #NA
have #NA
been #NA
keeping #NA
it #NA
uncovered #NA
but #NA
keeping #NA
it #NA
as #NA
clean #NA
as #NA
I #NA
can. #NA
Still #NA
hurts #SB
to #SC
the #SC
touch #SC
and #NA
a #NA
yellowish #SB
liquid #SC
comes #NA
out #NA
whenever #NA
the #NA
scab #NA
is #NA
either #NA
cut #NA
open #NA
accidentally #NA
from #NA
daily #NA
actions #NA
or #NA
highly #NA
irritated. #NA
Is #NA
this #NA
normal #NA
or #NA
what #NA
should #NA
I #NA
do #NA
to #NA
follow #NA
up #NA
with #NA
this #NA
issue. #NA
I #NA
didn't #NA
think #NA
it #NA
was #NA
serious #NA
enough #NA
