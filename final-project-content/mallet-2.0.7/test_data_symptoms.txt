I am a 20 year old girl from Austria, have been to many doctors but no one listens.
I recently ate outside in a roadside diner.
Since then i am suffering with constant vomiting and fall in ill often.
My stomach feels as if it is on fire and i need to drink a lot of water and thus use the bathroom more.
I had a headache for 3 days.
Continues to feel as if hit by bowling ball just below the chest. 
What can I do to help myself.
 
Hi, i am suffering from "Shortness of Breath" and this
generally occurs twice or thrice in a fortnight and this symptom is 
not dependent on carrying out any strenuous physical activity. 
Although i smoke/drink  on occasion i hope that is not the reason. 
So was just curious to know if this "Shortness of Breath" is being 
caused as a part of development of any cancer tissue or tuberculosis?
And yes,i have no allergic symptoms.
Please help me out.

I recently went to my village. Since i have come back from there
i have had loose motion and also have skin infection near groin and butt area. 
Its reddish and boilish.
It seems the water there was polluted or that it did not suit me.
I feel the weakness. My stamina has dropped down to very low compared to before.
My head feels as if it is spinning and i have to lie down in order for it to subside.
Please help me with my condition.

Woke up today feeling like i was walking on the sky. 
I felt very light-headed. 
All my movements feel like they are slow motion it's is like I have to really think 
about how I want to move my body. I have never felt this way before and i seem to 
use up a lot of energy in the process of doing any work.
Nowadays I wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep. 
It is hard to think clearly. I feel devoid of strength even when i am eating properly.
All of the strange feeling are in my sense of touch and motion. 
Please diagnose the problem and provide me with a solution.
