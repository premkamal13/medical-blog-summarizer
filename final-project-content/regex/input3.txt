I recently went to my village. Since i have come back from there
i have had loose motion and also have skin infection near groin and butt area. 
Its reddish and boilish.
It seems the water there was polluted or that it did not suit me.
I feel the weakness. My stamina has dropped down to very low compared to before.
My head feels as if it is spinning and i have to lie down in order for it to subside.
Please help me with my condition.
