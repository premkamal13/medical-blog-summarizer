have to really think 
about how i want to move my body
have never felt this way before and i seem to 
use up a lot of energy in the process of doing any work
feeling like i was walking on the sky
feeling are in my sense of touch and motion
felt very light-headed
felt this way before and i seem to 
use up a lot of energy in the process of doing any work
