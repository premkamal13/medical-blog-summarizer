I am a 20 year old girl from Austria, have been to many doctors but no one listens.
I recently ate outside in a roadside diner.
Since then i am suffering with constant vomiting and fall in ill often.
My stomach feels as if it is on fire and i need to drink a lot of water and thus use the bathroom more.
I had a headache for 3 days.
Continues to feel as if hit by bowling ball just below the chest. 
What can I do to help myself?
