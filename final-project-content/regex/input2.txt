Hi, i am suffering from "Shortness of Breath" and this
generally occurs twice or thrice in a fortnight and this symptom is 
not dependent on carrying out any strenuous physical activity. 
Although i smoke/drink  on occasion i hope that is not the reason. 
So was just curious to know if this "Shortness of Breath" is being 
caused as a part of development of any cancer tissue or tuberculosis?
And yes,i have no allergic symptoms.
Please help me out.
