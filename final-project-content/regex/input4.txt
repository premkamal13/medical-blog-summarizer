Woke up today feeling like i was walking on the sky. 
I felt very light-headed. 
All my movements feel like they are slow motion it's is like I have to really think 
about how I want to move my body. I have never felt this way before and i seem to 
use up a lot of energy in the process of doing any work.
Nowadays I wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep. 
It is hard to think clearly. I feel devoid of strength even when i am eating properly.
All of the strange feeling are in my sense of touch and motion. 
Please diagnose the problem and provide me with a solution.
