Hello, I practice ashtanga yoga once or twice a week and ride my bicycle around town. Yesterday evening I went to a yoga session and was taught a new posture that required a high level of flexibility in my knees, in addition to performing several others in the same session that are normally demanding on knees, and then I rode home on my bike. 

I've never had a problem before with my knees (I'm hyperflexible so I've always taken care to try and not overextend my joints), but after my session I noticed a bulbous lump behind my knee. It doesn't hurt, really, but I feel stiffness, weakness and a general feeling of "I should not be doing this" pressure in the area when I walk or move my knee. I did my research, of course. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker's_cyst ...and I'm keeping off my feet and taking ibuprofen.

I only recently signed up for health insurance a week ago and haven't received my policy papers yet in the mail. I'm not sure if I should wait to receive them and meanwhile see if it gets better, or if I should go to a doctor tomorrow. I should also note that I have no idea how much it would cost if my insurance is not in effect and I'm currently in between paychecks. 

Lastly, how long must the average person generally wait for it to heal/go away? Are we talking a week of no exercise and little walking, just sitting down, or less time, or more? Thanks in advance!
