Hello - Since April, I am a 29 yo female. Since April, I have been experiencing heavier periods. They tend to last about 4 days (with some days of light discharge after) but for 1-2 days the flow is much heaver than normal (usually for one day soaking through a tampon every 1-2 hours). 

Also, about three months ago, I experiened cramping mid cycle and had some very very light spotting for about one day. I am feeling Fatigue at times and it becomes difficut for me to stand. This happened again this past month. At times, I find it difficult in felling sleep. Sometimes, in middle of work,I feel like I will faint at any moment. I also sweat a lot during that time.


I should also mention three years ago I had an ectopic pregnancy and had emergency surgery to remove one of my fallopian tubes. During surgery the doctor mentioned I had some endometriosis that they removed, but that may need to be looked at in the future.

Thank you so much.
