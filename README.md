# medical-blog-summarizer
A software which takes the content of the blogs written by patients on the Online Doctoring websites, processes them to remove the errors, extracts the symptoms from the content and provides a brief summary of the problem described along with the category and the possible set of diseases. The target of the project is to save time of the doctors and ensure a quicker reply to the patients. The implementation of the software has been done in three ways: Dictionary based, Rules based &amp; Machine Learning based techniques to optimise the performance in various practical cases.
